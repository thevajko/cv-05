/**
 * Interface IHandleError
 *
 * This interface defines the contract for custom error handling classes within the application. Any class that
 * implements this interface must provide an implementation for handling errors represented by the HttpException class.
 *
 * The primary responsibility of implementing classes is to manage error scenarios gracefully, ensuring that users
 * receive meaningful feedback when exceptions occur during application execution. This interface allows for
 * flexibility in error handling strategies, accommodating different response formats based on the needs of the application.
 *
 * Implementing the handleError method allows developers to define custom logic for processing exceptions, including
 * how errors are logged, how user-facing messages are generated, and how responses are structured (e.g., JSON for APIs
 * or HTML for web pages).
